Analyzing temporal heat maps 

Certain spatio-temporal datasets(e.g. traffic) can be extremely large and hard to get insights from. An elegant way to quickly decipher them is to make heat maps and illustrate how they change with time. By making these custom animations, it is possible to get a broad summary of the data and enables to make quick conclusions which can serve as a basis for further analysis. We build a generalized framework to plot heat maps and then slice the data in time to show how they change with time. One of the possible contenders for this analysis is the New York Taxi dataset which has data from millions of taxi trips taken across the city. Using our visualization framework, we will be able to see an enormous data in a concise fashion and be able to make interesting observations which might be otherwise hard to capture.
